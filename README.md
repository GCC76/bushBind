# bushBind
Simple, fast and light but effective PHP class to protect data using reversible cryptography.
The encryption uses an obfuscation system based on the replacement of the single numerical values, derived from the ascii encoding of the string, with the keys of the array generated by the entered password and by a security token generated by the script.

Methods

bushEncript(string,password) : it returns a JSON file with the encrypted string in base64 format and a token to use fo decryption

bushDecript(string,password,token) : it returns a JSON file with the decripted string in base64 format.


Bush Bind cannot guarantee the security of data recovery protection from strong decription's tools. It is recommended to only extract the encryption result and its token. Don't keep the entire JSON document!
